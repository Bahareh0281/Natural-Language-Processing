# Introduction to Natural Language Processing - Spring 2024

This repository contains a collection of assignments and workshops completed during the **Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) Course** at **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)**. The course covered a wide range of NLP techniques and tools, focusing on both theoretical and practical aspects.

## Exercises

### Homework 1: Probabilistic N-Gram Language Model
- Implemented an N-Gram language model using probabilistic methods.

### Homework 2: Word Vectors
- Explored TF-IDF and Word2Vec techniques to understand and apply word vectors.

### Homework 3:
- **Q1: Enhancing Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**  
  Developed a tokenizer, improved tagging accuracy for unknown words, and introduced rule-based enhancements.
  
- **Q2: Building a Bigram Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Tagger**  
  Trained an HMM tagger, implemented the Viterbi algorithm, evaluated performance, and conducted error analysis.
  
- **Q3: Named Entity Recognition (NER) System**  
  Built an NER system to identify movie titles from IMDB and evaluated its performance on relevant text.

### Homework 4: Predicting Bitcoin Prices using LSTM
- Applied Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict Bitcoin prices.

### Homework 5:
- **Q9: Implementing Question Answering (QA) Systems**  
  Developed a QA system to provide answers based on context.

### Homework 6: Masked Language Model (MLM) Exploration
- Explored the architecture and application of Masked Language Models.

### Homework 7: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Farsi
- Focused on the development and analysis of Large Language Models tailored for the Farsi language.

## Workshops

### PyTorch Workshop
