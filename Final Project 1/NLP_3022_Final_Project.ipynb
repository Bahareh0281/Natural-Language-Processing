        "## What is RAG? 🤔\n",
        "We've all used ChatGPT and experienced moments when it starts to generate content that is often incorrect or unrelated to our query. Do you know why this happens? These Large Language Models (LLMs) are not magical entities; they are simply models trained on a vast amount of text. 📚 You could even consider a significant portion of the internet. However, this is not all the data available in the world, because data is not a static concept. You yourself generate some data every day through your use of the Internet, Social Media, and so on. 🌐💻📱\n",
        "\n",
        "So, no matter how much data you use to train your LLM, you always end up encountering new data. This is one of the reasons behind the famous ChatGPT response that tells you it only knows things up to a certain date. 📅 Also, these models tend to hallucinate too. It means they provide incorrect answers but in a very convincing manner. 🎭\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, we have retrieval techniques. Don't worry if it sounds complicated (it actually isn't easy, you may need to take a course to familiarize yourself with these concepts 😅, but that's not necessary for this project), but you use it on a daily basis. You can think of Search Engines (like Google, for example) as a complex form of information retrieval. 🔍\n",
        "\n",
        "So, one day, people came up with this idea that it would be cool if ChatGPT could search Google for us, read the articles for us, summarize what it read, and tell us that. 📖 So, this is not exactly what RAG is, but it's something similar. We have a corpus (a large amount of data) and a query (what a user typed as input). Now, we search through this corpus using techniques related to vectors and vector databases, and find the most similar items in our corpus to the query. Then, we pass these items to an LLM and ask for a structured, well-formatted, user-friendly output. 📈📊"

Initially, I wanted to use this article as the basis for this project, but unfortunately, the llama_index library used in the article seems to be outdated, so most of the code would need to be rewritten. On second thought, I found it more useful to focus on core concepts rather than learning specific libraries. You might want to check out some libraries like langchain or llama_index which provide a lot of tools for RAG. (But not for this project) 📝💡\n",
        "- Don't hesitate to use Google, ask chatbots about any new concepts and terms. If you use search engine-aware chatbots like Microsoft Copilot, they provide links for each part of their answers which is useful if you want to delve deeper into that part. 🌐🤖\n",

Clear cell tumors are also associated with the pancreas and salivary glands.\\nBenign and borderline variants of this neoplasm are rare, and most cases are malignant.\\nTypically, they are cystic neoplasms with polypoid masses that protrude into the cyst.\\nOn microscopic pathological examination, they are composed of cells with clear cytoplasm (that contains glycogen) and hob nail cells (from which the glycogen has been secreted).\\nThe pattern may be glandular, papillary or solid.', \"Two Japanese scientists commenced research into inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase in 1971 reasoning that organisms might produce such products as the enzyme is important in some essential cell wall components. This work lead to the identification of the first clinically useful compound lovastatin(mevinolin)  from a mould in the mid 1970's. This agent was first used in the more severe forms of hypercholesteraemia in the 1980s followed by landmark trials  with simvastatin that showed the potential for cardio-prevention.

A systolic BP measuring less than 90mmHg and/ or diastolic BP of less than 60mmHg is considered hypotension. A difference of 20 mmHg systolic BP and 10 mmHg diastolic BP is considered orthostatic hypotension (OH). Orthostatic hypotension is the most common type of hypotension, and neurogenic hypotension is demonstrated among 1/3rd of the individuals with OH. A decrease in blood pressure can be life-threatening in conditions such as anaphylaxis and addisonian crisis, and requires prompt treatment. It is important to access the possibility of head injury in a patient with syncope due to hypotension. ECG is an important and essential component of the evaluation of hypotension. Shock requires prompt management with fluids and vasopressors. For other causes of hypotension, identifying the cause and treatment is the best strategy. Lifestyle modifications are usually the first step in management. Medications causing a drop in blood pressure should be discontinued or changed to an appropriate alternative.']\n"

        "To create your retriever, you need to use an encoder model. Something like BERT? Nah, BERT is so yesterday. Find something new and shiny! ✨ The basic idea is to encode every document (sentence) in your corpus into a vector space using the same encoder. Then, encode the user query into that same space. With some similarity metrics like dot product, you can find the most similar document to the user’s input and retrieve it. 🎯 You can train your own encoder if you have enough data and resources, 💪 or you can use one of those [ready-made on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=trending), like these ones."

After several years of research, he concluded that \"People often catch a cold from one another when shut up together in small close rooms, or coaches; and when sitting near and conversing, so as to breathe in each other's transpiration.\" Although viruses had not yet been discovered, Franklin hypothesized that the common cold was passed between people through the air. He recommended exercise, bathing, and moderation in food and drink consumption to avoid the common cold.  Franklin's theory on the transmission of the cold was confirmed about 150 years later. \n",

In 1987, the unit completed its research on zinc gluconate lozenges for prophylaxis against rhinovirus.  In 1989, the unit was closed.\n",

Stinging insects inject venom into their victims, whilst biting insects normally introduce anti-coagulants into their victims.\n",

This is the typical response for all biting insects and many people have this common reaction to one extreme or another.\n",

After several years of research, he concluded that \"People often catch a cold from one another when shut up together in small close rooms, or coaches; and when sitting near and conversing, so as to breathe in each other's transpiration.\" Although viruses had not yet been discovered, Franklin hypothesized that the common cold was passed between people through the air. He recommended exercise, bathing, and moderation in food and drink consumption to avoid the common cold.  Franklin's theory on the transmission of the cold was confirmed about 150 years later. \n",

In 1987, the unit completed its research on zinc gluconate lozenges for prophylaxis against rhinovirus.  In 1989, the unit was closed.\n",

            "8. Maintain a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help support your immune system.\n",
            "9. Avoid touching your face: The common cold virus can enter your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth, so try to avoid touching these areas unnecessarily.\n",

            "This is recommended: Insect sting allergy is the term commonly given to the allergic response of an animal in response to the bite or sting of an insect. Typically, insects which generate allergic responses are either stinging insects (wasps, bees, hornets and ants) or biting insects (mosquitoes, ticks). Stinging insects inject venom into their victims, whilst biting insects normally introduce anti-coagulants into their victims.\n",
            "The great majority of insect allergic animals just have a simple allergic response - a reaction local to the sting site which appears as just a swelling arising from the release of histamine and other chemicals from the body tissues near to the sting site. The swelling, if allergic, can be helped by the provision of an anti-histamine ointment as well as an ice pack. This is the typical response for all biting insects and many people have this common reaction to one extreme or another.\n",
            "Mosquito allergy may result in a collection of symptoms called Skeeter Syndrome that occur after a bite. This syndrome may be mistaken for an infection such as cellulitis.\n",
            "In anaphylactic patients the response is more aggressive leading to a systemic reaction where the response progresses from the sting site around the whole body. This is potentially something very serious and can lead to anaphylaxis which is potentially life threatening. citation needed\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Swelling and redness**: Both bee stings and spider bites can cause swelling and redness at the site of the sting/bite. However, bee stings typically cause a more pronounced, immediate reaction, with a raised, red bump and a white, star-shaped pattern (the bee's stinger left behind).\n",

            "3. **Bee stinger**: If you see a small, barbed stinger left in the skin, it's likely a bee sting. Spiders don't have stingers, so you won't see one after a spider bite.\n",
            "4. **Systemic reaction**: If you experience a rapid, whole-body reaction with symptoms like difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, or dizziness, it could be an allergic reaction to a bee sting (anaphylaxis). Spider bites rarely cause anaphylaxis.\n",

Typically, insects which generate allergic responses are either stinging insects (wasps, bees, hornets and ants) or biting insects (mosquitoes, ticks). Stinging insects inject venom into their victims, whilst biting insects normally introduce anti-coagulants into their victims.\n",
            "The great majority of insect allergic animals just have a simple allergic response - a reaction local to the sting site which appears as just a swelling arising from the release of histamine and other chemicals from the body tissues near to the sting site. The swelling, if allergic, can be helped by the provision of an anti-histamine ointment as well as an ice pack. This is the typical response for all biting insects and many people have this common reaction to one extreme or another.\n",

This is potentially something very serious and can lead to anaphylaxis which is potentially life threatening. citation needed\n",
