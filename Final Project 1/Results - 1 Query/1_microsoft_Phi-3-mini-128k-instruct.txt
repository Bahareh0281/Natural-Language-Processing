1. Rest and hydration: Make sure to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids, such as water, herbal tea, or electrolyte-rich drinks.

2. Gentle exercise: Engage in light physical activity, such as stretching or walking, to help your body recover and maintain your energy levels.

3. Relaxation techniques: Try some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or listening to calming music, to help reduce stress and promote healing.

4. Nutritious meals: Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support your immune system and help your body fight off the infection causing your fever.

5. Avoid strenuous activities: While you're recovering, it's essential to avoid any strenuous activities that could worsen your condition or delay your recovery.
