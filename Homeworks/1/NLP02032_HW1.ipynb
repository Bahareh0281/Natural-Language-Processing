network in the tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak ', 'but financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off ', 'some said sumitomo may have paid too much for heiwa sogo in view of the smaller bank  s large debts ', 'others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch ', 'the analysts agreed

a fair statement  it would be almost naive not to think that ', 'pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as  opportunistic ', 'he said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain  then add management to restore profitability  or for banks in states where first interstate already operates  then cut costs by combining resources ', 'the exception  he said  would
