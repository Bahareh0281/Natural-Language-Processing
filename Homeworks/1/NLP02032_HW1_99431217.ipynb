It preprocesses the seed text using the preprocess_text function and initializes the generated text with the seed tokens. It then enters a loop to generate the remaining text until the minimum length is reached. In each iteration, it gets the context (tuple of the last n tokens) from the generated text and checks if it is in the model. If the context is in the model, it retrieves the probabilities for the next word based on the context. It filters the probabilities based on the threshold and selects the next word randomly using the random.choices function. The next word is added to the generated text. If the context is not in the model or no words are left after filtering, the loop breaks. Finally, the generated text is converted back to a string and returned."
