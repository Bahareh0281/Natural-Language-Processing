For example, \"leaves\" has both \"go_away\" and \"a_structure_of_a_plant\" meaning in the top 10, and \"scoop\" has both \"handed_waffle_cone\" and \"lowdown\". You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one.\n",

        "The `most_similar` function in word vector models like `Word2Vec` or `GloVe` uses cosine similarity to find words that are most similar to a given vector. When we use the expression `man:grandfather::woman:x` and calculate $x$ $=$ $g$ $-$ $m$ $+$ $w$, the resulting vector $x$ represents the relationship between `woman` and the missing word in the analogy.\n",

        "In this case, the vector $x$ $=$ $g$ $-$ $m$ $+$ $w$ captures the relationship `woman is to x` that is analogous to `man is to grandfather`. The resulting vector $x$ preserves some semantic and directional information based on the relationship between `man` and `grandfather`.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the most_similar function is not limited to finding exact matches or strict analogies. It operates by calculating cosine similarity between vectors. The function returns words that have high cosine similarity with the given vector, indicating that they are semantically related or have similar directional relationships.\n",

        "In the example, `grandmother` is the most intuitive word to complete the analogy. However, words like `granddaughter`, `daughter`, and `mother` are also returned by the `most_similar` function because they share some semantic and directional similarities with the vector x. These words are related to the concept of family and have a similar relationship to `woman` as `grandfather` does to `man`. They might have been frequently mentioned together in similar contexts during the training of the word vectors, leading to higher cosine similarity scores.\n",
        "\n",
